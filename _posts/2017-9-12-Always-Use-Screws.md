Well I resisted the inevitable for a long time, but writing stuff down is one of humanity's greatest achievements so who am I to argue with progress.  This will mostly be a technical blog, where I'll chronicle interesting technical problems/solutions as I come across them.  Partly to contribute to the hive-mind of information on the Internet, partly to train myself to think in a recordable manner.  It's really easy to brute-force your way into a solution, it's a little harder to step back, create something in a logical and reproduceable manner, then explain it to someone else.  I don't guess this blog will stand out from the crowd, but maybe something will show up in a google search somewhere and some piece of info will totally save someone's day.  Or for the prospective employer reading this look at how good I can R do english good!

# Always Use Screws

So I picked this name out of a heat induced fugue of manual labor and partly because it was obscure enough to be available.  My father-in-law was selling his house, and had a storage shed that the buyer didn't want.  He asked if I'd like it and of course I said yes!  Now it was free of charge, but I had to help take it apart, move it, and reassemble it.  Not a bad deal, the only downside being that it was August in SE Texas.  So basically like the surface of the sun on a good day. So after a day of disassembly that was much harder than expected, I began the task of removing the nails and staples from all the lumber and wall panels.  It was 100 degrees in the shade, I had mostly run out of sweat, and whoever built this thing must have been really excited to use a nail gun.  There were nails everywhere, and a staple or two between each one for good measure.  It was in that moment, between gasping expletives, that I swore I would always use screws whenever I built anything.  Screws were more expensive and more time consuming, and completely unneccessary if you're never going to take the thing apart.  But on the off chance you do have to take apart that permanent building, it will all be worth it.

Later that evening when I had cooled off and higher brain function returned, it occurred to me that 'Always Use Screws' was a good mindset for scripting and tool building.  You should always build something in a way that it can be dismantled by others.  Even if it takes longer, even if you have to try it a few times, even if you're certain it's just a one time thing that will never be dismantled.  Because it's not, and it will.  And even if it isn't, it's just a good mindset to help you build things better.  That first time you do it the hard way will suck.  And the next few times as well, but eventually thinking with screws (hey that's not a bad line either) will get easier, and then one day it'll really be the better way to do something and you'll already be proficient in it. Like this blog; I'll be dismantling scripts I've written and pointing out where I've used screws and where I've used nails (not sure what the staples would be in this analogy but I'm sure they'd be something awful, like sendkeys).  Maybe just knowing that I'll have to explain something here will be a good reminder to be a little more thoughtful in my design.

Now full disclosure, during re-assembly of the aforementioned shed it was still 100 degrees, and the siren song of the nail gun was just too much for my poor heat-stroked heart to resist.  So it's totally full of nails.  But rather than admit hipocracy and defeat I'll go with:

## There are exceptions to every rule

Sometimes just creating something that works is more valuable than creating something perfect.  Also like this blog.  I'm no great writer, but if I wait until I am then I'll never write anything.  Hopefully with practice it will get better.  Your tools will get better as you learn from your mistakes.  And one day I may go out (on a cool winter's day) and replace those nails with screws; and then never tear down that shed again.
