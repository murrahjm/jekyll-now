# 100 Days of Azure

Welcome!
This is the beginning of my adventure into the depths of the Azure Cloud Platform.
I had this crazy idea, and while it's probably not the first of this type, it should be interesting.
This post will hopefully be the first of 100, in which I explore, and document, a different area of Azure each day.
While I don't expect these to be super long and in depth, I do plan to have each article be a useful exploration of a given topic, and will attempt to include demos and code where it makes sense.
Also, while I would like to write an actual new article every day, and be done in 100 days, I suspect life and work will get in the way, so don't expect a daily update.  But I'll sure try.
As my twitter friend [Josh Duffney](https://twitter.com/joshduffney) reminded me, if you want to get better at a thing, you have to do the thing over and over again.



My goals for this project are pretty simple:

* Learn [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), [GitHub](https://github.com), etc.
* Get better at writing quickly and effectively
* Share my excitement at geeking out on new technology (expect lots of excited emotes and sidebars in the posts)
* Create a body of work that I or others could reference in the future (assuming it isn't all deprecated as soon as I write about it)

Where I go with this is mostly undecided so far, and will probably just depend on what I am most curious about and where it that takes me.
Despite that ambiguity, I do have a general plan for how I will lay things out.
Generally, I intend to pick an item (IAAS VMs, Vnets, etc.), and explore it in the following order:
* Azure Portal
* ARM Templates
* Ansible Modules
* Terraform

This is all speculation, but it feels like a good way to build upon previous articles to add complexity while still being able to focus on a single subject.


> **Help Requested**: I don't yet have all 100 days planned, or really more than the first few.
If you have a part of Azure that you'd like me to write about, or something that you think would be important to know, please, please, please reach out.

# The Articles

Here is where I will include links to the articles as I write them.
This will be the *Table of Contents*, effectively, and a good place to bookmark if you want to follow along.
