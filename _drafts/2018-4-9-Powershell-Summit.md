title: Powershell Summit
---

I could write a book about Powershell Summit, and I've only been through the first day.  Both the breadth and depth of innovation in this space is staggering.  But I don't want to talk about Powershell.  Because it isn't really about Powershell.  Powershell is an amazing tool that can enable any number of things, and accelerate everything else.  But it isn't really about Powershell.

# It's about the People

Someone told me that when I was young and dumb, and starting my career.  Of course I didn't listen, because people, by and large, are dumb I thought.  I would be smarter than them, and therefore didn't need people to get in the way.  There is no lack of technological problems that can be solved by locking yourself in a room and just working really hard.  In fact you can make a great career being really smart and really hardworking.

But there is also no shortage of problems to be solved that take vision, and forethought, and collaboration.  And these are the hardest, and most rewarding problems.  The people that solve these problems are the ones you read about, the visionaries, the leaders.  But no one has a literal crystal ball.  These "visions" don't come from quiet solitary reflection next to a windslept lake at the top of a mountain.  They come from talking to people.  Listening to people.  Being accutely aware of the environment that is greater than one person.  Because at the end of the day both the problem and the solution are really about people.

# Technology is easy, People are hard

Computers are great.  For a lot of reasons, but most of all because if you give a computer a task, it will do it.  The same way over and over again.  It's predictable, it's comforting.  People are none of those things.  

# First Time Speaker

In addition to being my first time attending the Summit, it was also my first time speaking.  I had a presentation that was mostly a sharing of things I had discovered and was excited to share with the community.  I was a little nervous from time to time, and definitely underestimated the amount of time it would take to prepare a good presentation.  But I managed to get all that done and had enough practice time to feel pretty confident about it.

Bottom line it was an amazing experience.  Just putting myself out there and being open to the responses, for better or worse, really made me feel like a part of this community.  All the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.  I was definitely not prepared for the feels when people told me that I helped them understand something, or gave them some great ideas, or even just entertained them.  That was a fantastic thing each and every time it happened.

But even better than that was the guy (you know who you are) that came up and said that he had a better way to do something I had presented on.  Usually I hate being wrong about anything, and the thought that I was up there telling people something that wasn't 100% correct should be mortifying.  But it was none of those things.  It was exciting.  We chatted for a minute then he pulled out his laptop.  Right there in the hallway, perched on a beverage cart, he showed me some code and we tried a few things and I learned something great.  It was amazing!  It was community.  I have no doubt that that gentleman will be presenting himself next year at summit, and I can't wait to see his presentation.  Because it isn't just about the code, it's about people.
